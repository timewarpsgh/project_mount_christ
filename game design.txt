Project Mount Christ (Unchated Waters 2 Online ) Game Design [how it looks to a player]


Feels like unchated waters 2.

But it's an online game. You can interact with roles in port and at sea controlled by other players.

keep it close to history and possible, no magic.

Graphics need to be changed, can use old graphics during early dev,
new assets need to match the old ones.

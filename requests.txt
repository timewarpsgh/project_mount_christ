TO DO:

    mates can earn xp and lv up OK
        xp in acc:  got when cargo sold, only flagship captain and accountant gets   OK
        xp in nav: got when discovery made, all captains and chief navigator gets   OK
        xp in bat:  got when npc battle won, all captains and first mate gets  OK

    mate's 3 attributes should be useful (crude enough for now)
        accounting,
            buy and sell cargo refactored into role OK
            buy cargo, with discount 100=20% 200=40%    OK
            sell cargo with discount 100=20% 200=40%  OK

        navigation, together with ship's tacking/power decides [speed] ON
            at sea sail faster
                navigation = 100  200
                tacking = 60      100
                power = 60        100

                season_mgr
                    each hour, change season, and weather

                    season

                    wind_dir
                    wind_speed

                    current_dir
                    current_speed

            in battle, more steps

        battle, attack and defence for shooting and engaging


DONE:

    clear menu when other menus are up OK

        mate
        lv_in_nav
        lv_in_acc
        lv_in_bat

        xp_in_nav (all with job gets after discovery)
        xp_in_acc (only u and accountant gets after selling)
        xp_in_bat (all with job gets after battle wins)

        when xp reaches lv max, lv up, 1,2 or 3 points added to that field(navigation),
        depending on talent(better random chance)

    hire mate  OK
    fire mate OK
    assign duty OK

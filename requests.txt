        lv 1, finding mates, trade

        lv 10, focus on exploration
            Naples, bar,
                Tommy: So, it's called Mount Vesuvius right?
                John: Right.
                Charlie: Mount Vesurvivors?
                Amy: Mount Vesuvius...
                Charlie: Yep, that's what I mean.
                Tommy: Located at 40N 14e.
                John: I like your writing style. Everything is organized and it's easy
                      to find and recognize the details. But what's the point of
                      writing all the discoveries down? After seeing one, I just remember it.
                Tommy: It's for people who don't have a chance to see for themselves
                      like Mr. Gary. I know words often fail at capturing the elegance of a discovery,
                      but they have their advantages.
                Amy: Like they are cheap?
                Charlie: Like they can not be dangerous?
                Tommy: Like they can last long if they are written properly.

                Someone: Do you guys know Pompei?
                Charlie: Pompei?
                Someone: It's a city close to Mount Vesuvius. The whole city was destroyed by the
                       eruption of Mount Vesuvius a long time ago. Many people were buried under
                       ashes.
                Amy: uh...
                Tommy: An eruption might be a sight to watch from a distance, but if you get too
                       close, you get yourself in trouble.

                Someone: Do you guys know Mount Fuji?
                Charlie: What's that?
                Tommy: I hear it's a volcano in Japan.
                Someone: Yes. I once passed it on my ship many years ago. It was a cloudy day.
                        The peak was covered in fog. It was just beautiful. I remember it's at around
                        39N	139e.

            Sakai, bar,
                Tommy: Mount Fuji, 39N	139e.
                John: Tommy, what's so interesting about volcanoes? We came all the way here, and
                      just saw another volcano.
                Tommy: If you have seen enough examples of volcanoes, when you see a new volcano,
                      you can predict this new volcano's behavior based on the examples. Acurate
                      predictions can save lives.
                Amy: Wow.
                Charlie: Wow...

                Robert: I'm ruined. I'm done. My life has just met its lowest valley. I'm no
                     longer the most wanted man in the world!
                Sebastioon: That's true. You are second now. Congratulations! You may enjoy
                    a longer life due to the shift of the world's attention.
                Robert: ... Thank you, my brother. I feel better now, regardless of whether
                    a longer life is worth living.

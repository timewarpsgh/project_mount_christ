            Naples, bar,
                Tommy: So, it's called Mount Vesuvius right?
                John: Right.
                Charlie: Mount Vesurvivors?
                Amy: Mount Vesuvius...
                Charlie: Yep, that's what I mean.
                Tommy: Located at 40N 14e.
                John: I like your writing style. Everything is organized and it's easy
                      to find and recognize the details. But what's the point of
                      writing all the discoveries down? After seeing one, I just remember it.
                Tommy: It's for people who don't have a chance to see for themselves
                      like Mr. Gary. I know words often fail at capturing the elegance of a discovery,
                      but they have their advantages.
                Amy: Like they are cheap?
                Charlie: Like they can not be dangerous?
                Tommy: Like they can last long if they are written properly.

                Someone: Do you guys know Pompei?
                Charlie: Pompei?
                Someone: It's a city close to Mount Vesuvius. The whole city was destroyed by the
                       eruption of Mount Vesuvius a long time ago. Many people were buried under
                       ashes.
                Amy: uh...
                Tommy: An eruption might be a sight to watch from a distance, but if you get too
                       close, you get yourself in trouble.

                Someone: Do you guys know Mount Fuji?
                Charlie: What's that?
                Tommy: I hear it's a volcano in Japan.
                Someone: Yes. I once passed it on my ship many years ago. It was a cloudy day.
                        The peak was covered in fog. It was just beautiful. I remember it's at around
                        39N	139e.

            Sakai, bar,
                Tommy: Mount Fuji, 39N	139e.
                John: Tommy, what's so interesting about volcanoes? We came all the way here, and
                      just saw another volcano.
                Tommy: If you have seen enough examples of volcanoes, when you see a new volcano,
                      you can predict this new volcano's behavior based on the examples. Acurate
                      predictions can save lives.
                Amy: Wow.
                Charlie: Wow...






        lv 20, while exploring, overhears his's father's killer, Nicolas Fernandez
            english sailors speak evil of him, he should be killed
            pursue Nicolas

            Caracas, bar
                Sebastian: Robert. Robert... Robert!!! Wake the heck up! I can't believe
                    you got drunk. This is the first time I see you drunk.
                Robert: Oh, Sebastian. Sebastian... My dearest brother.
                Sebastian: Are... are you crying? My goodness. You gotta be crying.
                    I can't believe you are crying. I can't believe the world's most notorius
                    and handsome pirate is crying. Has Betty left you?
                Robert: You know nothing. Sebastion. Take a look at this incredible post.
                Sebastian: Whaaat? Looks like the English Navy has just added another person
                     to the wanted list. This Nicolas Fernandez of the Spanish Navy. A bounty
                     of 1100 Gold Ingots will be kindly provided for anyone who can bring him
                     to London, dead or alive. 1100? I remember your bounty is 1050.
                Robert: I'm ruined. I'm done. My life has just met its lowest valley. I'm no
                     longer the most wanted man in the world!
                Sebastioon: That's true. You are second now. Congratulations! You may enjoy
                    a longer life due to the shift of the world's attention.
                Robert: ... Thank you, my brother. I feel better now, regardless of whether
                    a longer life is worth living.

                Robert: Now, when I come to think of it, I wonder how this Nicolas Fernandez
                    managed to surpass my position.
                Sebastion: I heard the Spanish Navy caught the English Navy by surprise
                    some time ago. The English Navy suffered significant loss. Five ships of the line
                    were sunk. One ship was heavily damaged but still managed to escape
                    in rather desperate situations. Even
                    the Spanish talked about this ship with astonishment.
                Sebastion: Ah... I remember.
                Sebastion: Endurance. It's HMS Endurance.
                Sebastion: You may have plundered lots of English merchant ships without arms.
                    Nicolas Fernandez most likely commanded a fleet that dealt a heavy blow to
                    the formidable English Navy.
                Robert: I see. I'll practice more. I'll get up tomorrow at 4 am. And you'll come
                    with me.

            Caracas, inn
                Amy: These pirates are kind of cute.
                Charlie: 1100, isn't it? 1100 gold ingots for the head of Nicolas Fernandez.
                    I'm interested. Robert's bounty of 1050 looks OK but he seems weak. He's
                    not worth my time.
                Tommy: I like your confidence. But don't underestimate Nicolas. You have no
                    idea what you are dealing with.
                John: Let's find out what we are dealing with.
                Tommy: Alright. Alright. But where is he?
                Amy: My friend Mila works at the bar in Havana. That bar's often filled with
                    Spanish sailors. She might know.
                John: Let's go.

            Havana, bar
                Amy: Hey, Mila. Mila! It's Amy!
                Mila: Oh, Amy! Is that really you? I'm so happy to see you again!
                    Have you come for the tobacco here?
                Amy: Tobacco... I almost forgot. Havana has the best tobacco in the world.
                    If we trade ...
                Charlie: Um.. Um... Nicolas. Nicolas...
                Amy: Aye. Right. Do you know a Spanish guy called Nicolas Fernandez?
                Mila: Admiral Fernandez of the Spanish Navy? Of course. His fleet just sailed
                    south from here about a week ago. I hurried to the harbor and witnessed the
                    departure. There were 10 battle ships, all fully armored. The sailors lined
                    up by the side of the ships and soluted the harbor just as the sun rised
                    above the horizon in a partly cloudy day. The clouds were purple, red, and
                    golden.
                Amy: Do you know where he's headed?
                Mila: I heard multiple versions of their destination. They are likely all fake.
                Amy: True. You don't easily predict the operation of a navy fleet.
                    Thank you anyway.
                Mila: You are welcome.
